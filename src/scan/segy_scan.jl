Scan header fields `keys` of files in `dir` matching the filter `filt` in blocks
containing `blocksize` continguous traces. The scanning of files is distributed to workers
in `pool`, the default pool is all workers.

`chunksize` determines how many MB of data will be loaded into memory at a time.

`CHUNKSIZE` defaults to 2048MB.

`verbosity` set to 0 silences updates on the current file being scanned.
